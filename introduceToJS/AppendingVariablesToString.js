/**Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.


Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator. */
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "very amasing idea!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
