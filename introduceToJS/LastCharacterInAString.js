/**Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].


Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.

Hint
Try looking at the lastLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.
 */
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
