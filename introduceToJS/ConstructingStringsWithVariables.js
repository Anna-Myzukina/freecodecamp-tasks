/*Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.


Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"
 */
// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Anna";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
